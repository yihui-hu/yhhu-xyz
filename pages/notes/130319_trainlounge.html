                In the quiet, 11:48pm last train, who occupies it? Afterwards, where do trains underground go to rest: their harbouring area? Where is that, where all trains gather to grab drinks of fuel and diesel? How about the conductors? Is there a super secret lounge along the tracks that run under the local reservoirs that has space for all these?
