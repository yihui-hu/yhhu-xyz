            Previously, I had a website on cargo.site (childrenofthesun.one) ⤵&#xFE0E; 
            </p>

            <div>
            <img class="border" src="../../images/cargosite19.png" alt="childrenofthesun.one circa 2019">
            <figcaption>circa aug 2019 (when I was far more ambitious...)<figcaption>
            <p></p>

            <img class="border" src="../../images/cargosite20.png" alt="childrenofthesun.one circa 2020">
            <figcaption>circa dec 2020<figcaption>

            </div>

            <p>
            I paid $99/yr for two years, on top of $13/yr for a custom domain. It seems the price has gone up since (now $14/mth billed yearly = $168)<sup><a class="inline" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Setting up this website using Github Pages is free, and the custom domain (I use namecheap; .xyz domains are some of the cheapest out there) only costs ~$6/year. So that's 6% of what I used to pay, and 3% of what it would cost now. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I will say that cargo is excellent for showcasing portfolios, which was my main purpose 3 years back. I didn't have much (if any at all) programming knowledge, and cargo is super easy to set up and use for non-programmers, especially those who are visually inclined. It is to coding HTML & CSS in VS Code what Microsoft Word is to LaTeX (i.e. WYSIWYG). 
            </p>

            <p>
            <img class="normal" src="../../images/cargosite.gif" alt="cargo site portfolio">
            </p>

            <p>
            The complimentary font selection on cargo is great (they just added new fonts from the Dinamo foundry) and the ability to tap on images for a zoomed in view is handy (I'm pretty sure there's a way to do that on here as well but I haven't looked into it yet). The wireframe and reference templates are clean. There are nice transitional animations, cool image/gif filters, custom gallery layouts for images that can also be movable... 
            </p>

            <p>
            But optimising for mobile/tablet screens with cargo is a lot more difficult that it appears. I remember spending much time fiddling around with different viewports, making sure everything looked OK on various screen sizes. 
            </p>

            <p>
            With HTML & CSS all it required was this snippet of code for the layout I had in mind: 
            </p>

            <p>
            <img class="normal" src="../../images/deviceviewport.png" alt="code snippet for device viewport">
            </p>

            <p>
            And right now, for me, tinkering around with raw HTML & CSS (and some javascript) is a lot more fun. Getting the layout exactly how I want is also somehow easier than using the "blocks" that cargo has, but much of the complex layout that cargo affords is gone, which is a little sad but I don't need anything too fancy for right now. And the entire website can be stored on a folder or hard drive that takes up &lt;30mb (currently); I don't have to worry about migrating to other platforms, or depend on cargo.site to run indefinitely. I do want to clean up the files someday though, and optimise my website to use less space and run even faster (might want to borrow some ideas from <a class="inline" target="_blank" href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html">https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about</a>).

            1. But what's nice is that non-profit organisations and students at one of their select institutions (e.g. RISD, ArtCenter College of Design) will have access to cargo for free, or you could get a faculty member to apply for membership to the program.
