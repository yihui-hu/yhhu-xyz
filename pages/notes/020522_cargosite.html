            Previously, I had a website on cargo.site (childrenofthesun.one)<sup id="footnote1"><a class="footnote"
                    href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> <span style="font-size:0.8rem">⤵&#xFE0E;</span>
        </p>

            I paid $99/yr on top of $13/yr for a custom domain with my paltry military pay (on hindsight, not a good use
            of it). It seems the price has gone up since (now $14/mth billed yearly = $168)<sup id="footnote2"><a
                    class="footnote" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In comparison, setting up this website using Github Pages is free, and the custom domain (.xyz domains are
            some of the cheapest) costs $6/year. So that's 5% of what I used to pay, and 3% of what it would cost now.

            I will say that cargo is excellent for showcasing portfolios, which was my main purpose 3 years back. I
            didn't have much programming knowledge then, and cargo is easy to set up and use for non-programmers and
            those who are more visually inclined. It is to hard-coding HTML & CSS what Microsoft Word is to LaTeX (i.e.
            WYSIWYG, and I think services like cargo are also known as content management system platforms, or CMS
            platforms).

        <p>Some things I miss about cargo:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>complimentary font selection (partnering with foundries like Dinamo)</li>
            <li>zoom in options for images on tap (I'm sure there's a way to do that on here as well, but I haven't
                looked into it yet)</li>
            <li>clean wireframe and reference templates</li>
            <li>easy to apply transitions/animations</li>
            <li>unorthodox image/gif filters</li>
            <li>custom gallery layouts with movable images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            But oddly enough, optimising for mobile/tablet screens with cargo is a lot more difficult that it appears. I
            remember spending much time fiddling around with different viewports, making sure everything looked OK on
            various screen sizes. These sorts of details are important to me.

            With HTML & CSS, this snippet of code was all I needed:

            And right now, tinkering around with raw HTML & CSS (w/ some javascript) is a lot more enjoyable. Getting
            the layout exactly how I want is also somehow easier than using the 'blocks' that cargo has. It is a little
            sad to lose the ability to quickly build a complex layout using cargo, but I really don't need anything too
            fancy for right now<sup id="footnote3"><a class="footnote" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>.

            1. Going through my small archive of website iterations on cargo, there's an odd smattering of found words
            and images on there which I might want to revisit and reshape one day.<a class="inline" href="#footnote1">

            2. But what's nice is that non-profit organisations and students at one of their select institutions (e.g.
            RISD, ArtCenter College of Design) will have access to cargo for free. There's also the option of getting a
            faculty member to apply for membership to the program.<a class="inline" href="#footnote2"> ↩&#xFE0E;</a>

            3. And I don't have to worry about migrating to other platforms, or depend on cargo.site to run
            indefinitely. Currently, this entire website can be stored on a folder or hard drive that takes up &lt;30mb.
            I do want to clean up the files someday though, and optimise my website to use less space and run even
            faster (re: <a class="inline" target="_blank" href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html">low tech
                magazine</a>).
