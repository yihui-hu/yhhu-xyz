            Previously, I had a website on cargo.site (childrenofthesun.one)<sup><a class="footnote" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> ⤵&#xFE0E; 
            </p>

            <div>
            <img class="border" src="../../images/cargosite19.png" alt="childrenofthesun.one circa 2019">
            <figcaption>circa aug 2019 (when I was far more—way too—ambitious)<figcaption>
            <p></p>

            <img class="border" src="../../images/cargosite20.png" alt="childrenofthesun.one circa 2020">
            <figcaption>circa dec 2020<figcaption>
            <p></p>

            <img class="normal" src="../../images/cargosite21.png" alt="childrenofthesun.one circa 2021">
            <figcaption>circa may 2021</figcaption>
            </div>

            <p>
            I paid $99/yr on top of $13/yr for a custom domain with my paltry military pay (on hindsight, not a good use of it). It seems the price has gone up since (now $14/mth billed yearly = $168)<sup><a class="footnote" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>.
            </p>

            <p>
            In comparison, setting up this website using Github Pages is free, and the custom domain (.xyz domains are some of the cheapest) costs $6/year. So that's 5% of what I used to pay, and 3% of what it would cost now. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I will say that cargo is excellent for showcasing portfolios, which was my main purpose 3 years back. I didn't have much programming knowledge then, and cargo is easy to set up and use for non-programmers and those who are more visually inclined. It is to hard-coding HTML & CSS what Microsoft Word is to LaTeX (i.e. WYSIWYG). 
            </p>

            <p>
            <img class="normal" src="../../images/cargosite.gif" alt="cargo site portfolio">
            </p>

            <p>Some things I miss about cargo:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>complimentary font selection (partnering with foundries like Dinamo)</li>
                <li>zoom in options for images on tap (I'm sure there's a way to do that on here as well, but I haven't looked into it yet)</li>
                <li>clean wireframe and reference templates</li>
                <li>easy to apply transitions/animations</li>
                <li>unorthodox image/gif filters</li>
                <li>custom gallery layouts with movable images</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            But oddly enough, optimising for mobile/tablet screens with cargo is a lot more difficult that it appears. I remember spending much time fiddling around with different viewports, making sure everything looked OK on various screen sizes. These sorts of details are important to me.
            </p>

            <p>
            With HTML & CSS, this snippet of code was all I needed: 
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
            And right now, tinkering around with raw HTML & CSS (w/ some javascript) is a lot more enjoyable. Getting the layout exactly how I want is also somehow easier than using the 'blocks' that cargo has. It is a little sad to lose the ability to quickly build a complex layout using cargo, but I really don't need anything too fancy for right now<sup><a class="footnote" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>.

            <p id="footnote-1">
                1. Going through my small archive of website iterations on cargo, there's an odd smattering of found words and images on there which I might want to revisit and reshape one day.
            </p>

            <p id="footnote-2">
                2. But what's nice is that non-profit organisations and students at one of their select institutions (e.g. RISD, ArtCenter College of Design) will have access to cargo for free. There's also the option of getting a faculty member to apply for membership to the program.

                3. And I don't have to worry about migrating to other platforms, or depend on cargo.site to run indefinitely. Currently, this entire website can be stored on a folder or hard drive that takes up &lt;30mb. I do want to clean up the files someday though, and optimise my website to use less space and run even faster (re: <a class="inline" target="_blank" href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html">low tech magazine</a>).
