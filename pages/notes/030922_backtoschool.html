            It's currently 10:10am SGT, flying off in less than 24 hours.
            I'll probably be reading up on C during the long flight (or sleeping, who knows) so I can get a head start
            on my classes. But before that, I thought I'd write a quick note on how summer's been for me. Documentation.
            <br><br>

            For the first half of summer, I spent a lot of it on learning web development. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and frameworks such as React, API calls, etc. And with the help of many online tutorials from YouTube and Scrimba, I was able to work on quite a number of personal projects:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://pokesearch.xyz" target="_blank">pokéSearch</a> (pseudo-pokedex... was supposed to do a proper write-up on this re: my previous post... but I wanted to spend more time building other things. maybe some day)
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://yhhu.design" target="_blank">yhhu.design</a> (personal portfolio)
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://y-experiments.netlify.app" target="_blank">y-experiments</a> (art / design experiments)
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://sites-i-like.vercel.app" target="_blank">sites-i-like</a> (sites i like lol)
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://foundation-recreation.netlify.app/" target="_blank">foundation-recreation</a> (recreation of foundation.app)
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        among other mocked-up websites for practice that currently live only on localhost.

        <br><br>
        I looked into Svelte, Rust and SwiftUI as well, and those are what I'm planning to learn in the future.
        
        <br><br>
        But other than that, it's been a pretty relaxing yet also eventful summer. I bouldered and clubbed for the first time. Exercised almost daily. Caught up with friends I hadn't seen in over a year. Cut my hair short. Played a lot of games on my Switch (more so lately, and Earthbound is GOTY contender).

        <br><br>
        Honestly, the upcoming semester will probably destroy me, seeing how unkind the previous was to me. I've got a boatload of worries to iron out ahead of me, but at the same time from which many opportunities will spring, hopefully.

        <br><br>
        That's all for now.</p>

        <p>
        Misc. notes/thoughts:
        <ul>
            <li>I really should & need to start taking more photos!</li>
            <li>Bouldering is super fun, until you scrape skin off your fingers. Then it goes from a 10/10 to a 9.8/10. Still incredible. Really feels like a return to our most primate roots</li>
            <li>I think board game cafes are underrated, and value for money.</li>
            <li>Haven't really been reading a lot. Battle Royale was mid, After Steve was pretty good, Blood Sweat and Pixels was pretty good too. Hope to be able to complete my reading challenge this year...</li>
            <li>4 CS classes and 1 philosophy class this sem. Definitely, most likely, maybe going to drop one. No thanks to my past overzealous self.</li>
        </ul>
