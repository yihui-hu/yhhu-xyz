            <p>
            There's always a very small time window of about 10-15 minutes where the sky turns this shade of dark blue, not yet pitch black
            </p>

            <p>How can I prolong this fleeting shade of blue?</p>

            <p>If I travel by car across land?</p>

            <p>I probably need the amount of time it takes for this deep blue to occur, to when it becomes pitch black. 
                
            And the direction in which the sun is setting, I need to head the opposite of it, at the right speed.</p>
                
            <p>Like so? ↘&#xFE0E; path of setting sun ← direction of motion</p>
