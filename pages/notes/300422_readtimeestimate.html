            In the interest of learning new things, I decided to work on implementing a reading time estimate to my notes. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I found a javascript snippet online that does just that and modified it slightly, adding comments that might be helpful for future reference: 
            </p>

            <img class="normal" src="../../images/timeestimate.png" alt="time estimate .js snippet">
            </p>

            <p>
            Also, since the total word count was already stored in a variable, I decided to surface that number and have it exist alongside the reading time estimate. Might as well. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I'm interested to experiment with more javascript. How I understand it is a way of embedding functions into your websites and making them more dynamic/interactive. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Small implementation note: stored the .js file in a separate folder, and used &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; to call them in the html files. This means I could probably have a bunch of separate .js files for each function I want to use, and call them when needed... very cool
