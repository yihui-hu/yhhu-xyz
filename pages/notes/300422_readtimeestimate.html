            <p>
            In the interest of learning new things, I decided to work on implementing a reading time estimate to my notes. 
            </p>

            <p>
            After some expertly executed and strenuous google searching, I found a javascript snippet on the first page of results that does just that and modified it slightly, adding comments that might be helpful for future reference: 
            </p>

            <p>
            <img class="normal" src="../../images/timeestimate.png" alt="time estimate .js snippet">
            </p>

            <p>
            Also, since the total word count was already stored in a variable, I decided to surface that number and have it exist alongside the reading time estimate<sup id="footnote1"><a class="footnote" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>. Might as well. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I'm interested in experimenting with more javascript. How I understand it as of right now is that it is an easy way of embedding functions into websites and making them more dynamic/interactive. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Small implementation note: I stored the .js file in a separate folder, and used &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; to call them in the html files. This means I could probably have a bunch of separate .js files for each function I want to use, and call them when needed... very useful
            </p>

            <hr style="margin-top: 2em;margin-bottom: 1em;">

            <p id="footnote-1">
                1. I have since removed this word count because it serves no real purpose other than taking up space, or revealing how bad I am at long-form content (re: my inability to produce anything meaningful in that space). <a class="inline" href="#footnote1">↩&#xFE0E;</a>
            </p>
