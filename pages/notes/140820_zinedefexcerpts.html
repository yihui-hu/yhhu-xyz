            You have no idea how much I envied that mynah. In the dead of night, way before dawn crept, it kept us company. Me and my buddy, baton and riot shield in hand, walking up and down the depressingly hollow stretch that connected the entrance of Tekong to the ferry terminal. It flew around us for about half an hour, curious about every bit of stray plastic that we swept with our feet. At that point, my buddy and I had exhausted all topics of interest to talk about. So we kept our unspoken silent pact and instead let our minds wander. I don't know what busied his mind; all I knew was that the mynah was all I could keep my eyes on. What limited capacity for focus I had remaining, I spent it all on that mynah. So restless. So carefree. I remember, on that night, the sea was eerily still; waves minimal. That mynah was just about the only living source of energy there. I wondered to myself, <span class="italic">"Did you come from the mainland, or are you a native resident of Tekong?"</span> My mind thus drifted to imagining the bird taking a really long flight from SFT to Tekong. And what if it had taken place in the middle of the night? One of my greatest fears is being stranded in the middle of the sea, but even more so at night — absolute darkness. The horizon is no longer separated by sky and water; two halves bleed and mix to black. That must be what hopelessness looks like. And I couldn't help but envy the mynah even more, for it must have mustered an enormous amount of courage to embark on that journey. At the same time, I feared for it. Just as I had finished that thought, it flew away for good. To where, I do not know. I watched it glide over the dark waters before it too dissolved to black. <span class="italic">"And we still have two more hours,"</span> I sighed and said, to no one in particular.

            The best part about completing an hour-long prowling session around camp is when you get to take off your heavy ILBV (vest) in the air conditioned resting area. As soon as you lift it off your shoulders, a heat wave rises from your chest to fog up your glasses. All the sweat and warmth that stuck to your chest escapes in an instant. I dump my ILBV on the ground to air before checking my next shift, and afterwards, I head into the meeting room to join the group; the other poor saps saddled with guard duty. But we make do with small talk and share jokes to pass the time. They're about as esoteric as any zoomer meme out there. Try "locked corn". I don't know why but we laughed at that for a really, really long time. It took a while to develop that 'joke': an amalgamation of real life course proceedings and farming sim lingo. <span class="italic">"Anyone want to order in macs?"</span> That rhetorical question usually occurs sometime between 1 and 3 in the morning, when most of us are done with our second/third shift. For those still on duty, we just keep it warm in the broken fridge out back. It's nice to know that when you get back, you have a halfway soggy meal waiting for you. Devour it, get some rest. On prowling: it's scary as f--- at night. Nothing but blinking street lights and the throaty croaks of toads. Some parts of our route aren't even lit. <span class="italic">"On the count of 3... 2... 1!"</span> and we dash to make it past those sections. <span class="italic">"You know about the guy who got scared by a stray dog and shot it?"</span> "NO?" and then a dog barks. CCTV manning is marginally better. You just stare at a bunch of screens showing the fencing around the perimeter of camp and the occasional passersby. <span class="italic">"Just sleep bro".</span> But sentry duty? It's fun with friends. Even funner with music. A little jive, here and there. Before you know it, day breaks.
