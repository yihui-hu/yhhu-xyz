            <p>Some notes on Liu Cixin's The Dark Forest (one of my top favourite books; major spoilers ahead):</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>the primary goal of every civilisation is survival</li>
                <li>matter in the universe is limited, but the expansion of civilisations is not</li>
                <li>chain of suspicions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The dark battle; doomsday battle; microcosm of the dark forest theory:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>teardrop, perfectly mirror surfaced trisolaran probe is sent to the space fleet of earth</li>
                <li>in 20 odd minutes destroys nearly all of them, except for Natural Selection and Bronze Age; Blue Space?</li>
                <li>once they all escape they set their course to the nearest moons of Jupiter to refuel</li>
                <li>but plans after that remain undetermined</li>
                <li>communications between vessels either slow, inhibited or unavailable: chains of suspicion develop</li>
                <li>Zhang Beihai plans for the use of hydro-something bombs to attack other vessels and claim their resources to rapidly increase their longevity but is too late as another ship attacks them</li>
                <li>soon all ships start attacking</li>
                <li>communication is not to be trusted in the first place due to distance, or the truth simply cannot be confirmed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Beyond distance, ecological, psychological and essentially biological differences between not only humans but also extraterrestrial beings inhibit trust and truths in communication (re: how trisolarans are unable to conceal the truth due to their conscience and voice being one and the same)</p>

            <hr style="margin-top: 2em;margin-bottom: 2em;">

            <p>The dark forest theory:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>every civilisation is a hunter stalking through the forest, careful not to leave any traces behind</li>
                <li>any and all forms of alien life will be eliminated immediately</li>
                <li>firstly, the reveal of one's location to another is deadly in itself. if a civilisation finds out the general location they only have one option:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>**important**; if a civilisation has found the location of another, sooner or later the reverse will be true. cognisant of that:</li>
                    <li>if the revealed civilisation is low level; taking into consideration the explosive exponential growth of technology and power, they will one day grow strong in power.</li>
                    <li>if the revealed civilisation is high level; they have no choice but to still attempt an assault either now or in the future for fear of being wiped out</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <hr style="margin-top: 2em;margin-bottom: 2em;">

            <p>Possibilities under this theory:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>nobody has found us yet</li>
                <li>some civilisation has found us and are plotting to eliminate us</li>
                <li>some civilisation has found us and are in the process of eliminating us (maybe they're lightyears away so it takes centuries/millenia to get here)</li>
                <li>some civilisation is "grooming us": cutting edge technology allows them to chart our development; monitor it. at our apex, they invade and take control of our resources, ideas and knowledge, before moving on</li>
                <li>we are still in the very early stages of development; none of this has happened or will happen just yet, but it will happen in the future</li>
                <li>or... extraterrestrial life simply does not exist.</li>
            </ul>
