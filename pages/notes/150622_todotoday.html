            (I have been busy enjoying my summer, so this post comes quite late relative to the project(s) contained
            within. Below is a (mostly) chronological log of the work I've done for the end of May. I just finished another project that I started in early June, and a post on that will be coming soon!)
        </p>

            May 20 2022:
            <br>
            I realised that I'm not very good at naming my projects as you can probably tell. Anyway I digress; I've
            been making some good progress on the todo "app" (I'm not sure it qualifies as one but let's call it that
            for now) which I briefly mentioned in my previous post.
        </p>

        <img class="normal" src="../../images/todo-today-v1.png" alt="todo-today">
        <figcaption>On hindsight, not a great shade of yellow/beige</figcaption>
        <p style="margin-top: 2vh"></p>

        <p>
            Most of what you see is placeholder content, but at least I've got the layout down for now.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, I guess I never learn—even after an absolutely tragic attempt at implementing light/dark mode for my
            personal website, I still went and tried to implement simple custom themes for this app. But the scope of
            this app is much smaller, so thankfully everything worked out in the end. I even managed to drastically
            mitigate the flickering on reload, but that's likely in no small part due to the app only having two real
            sections to switch between.
        </p>

        <p>
            With how it's set up in the css file, it's no problem to add even more themes down the line (the hard part
            is coming up with good colour schemes).
        </p>

        <img class="normal" src="../../images/todo-today-theme-code.png" alt="todo-today theme code snippet">
        <figcaption>Structure of themes in the css file</figcaption>
        <p style="margin-top: 2vh"></p>

        <p>
            That said, the app is still not fully operational; here's a short list of what to
            work on next:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Using localStorage to save incomplete/completed tasks (pretty rudimentary but essential)
            </li>
            <li>
                Ability to write notes on a separate 'notebook' (nice to have)
            </li>
            <li>
                Categorisation of to-dos (if I can...)<sup id="footnote1"><a class="footnote"
                        href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The UI right now also doesn't really accommodate for more than about 5 categories or notes. And it's pretty
            much unusable on mobile. But I just want to get it working for now.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this juncture I'm also thinking about converting the web app into a desktop app using something like
            Electron<sup id="footnote2"><a class="footnote" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>. It would be nice to design
            an app icon for that too.
        </p>

            May 21 2022:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Saving tasks with localStorage works now, still need to re-implement completion of tasks due to
                refactoring of code
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented ability to rename tasks
            </li>
            <li>
                Will also work on ability to delete incomplete/completed tasks
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

            May 21 2022 (late evening):
        <ul>
            <li>
                Okay Why Is Everything Everywhere Breaking All At Once
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            May 22 2022:
        <ul>
            <li>
                I took a break from the code (may or may not have touched grass) and with some simple refactoring, the
                code works again. Also implemented ability to delete tasks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            I have decided that implementing javascript animations is too complex and unnecessary for the time being, so
            I will redirect my focus to making a somewhat passable MVP, so that means working on a notes portion of the
            app (which I initially set out to do).

                    Managed to implement a notes section, code adapted from

            Launched the project using Netlify. Now live on <a class="inline" target="_blank" href="https://todo-today-simple.netlify.app">todo-today-simple.netlify.app</a>. Please don't visit it on mobile, it is very much broken there (my bad). This will do for now. At least it works, if somewhat clunkily.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an aside, my favourite theme is "Wine":

            !!! BONUS !!!
            <br>
            My fingers were still itching so I decided to create another simple app, adapted from the 8 ball mini project from codecademy's basic javascript crash course:
        </p>

        <img class="normal" src="../../images/magic-8-ball-simple.png" alt="magic 8 ball app">
        <figcaption>Ask your most burning questions</figcaption>
        <p style="margin-top: 2vh"></p>

        <p>
            The code for this is particularly simple:
        </p>

        <img class="normal" src="../../images/magic-8-ball-simple-code.png" alt="magic 8 ball simple code">
        <p style="margin-top: 2vh"></p>

        <p>
            Also live on <a class="inline" target="_blank" href="https://magic-8-ball-simple.netlify.app">magic-8-ball-simple.netlify.app</a>. It was relatively quick to put together. I think I'm getting warmed up to web programming! Next up, learning React. This might just be me learning to fly before walking but let's see how things go.

            1. I could not. Unfortunately, a bit too complex for me right now. Keeping track of localStorage between
            different categories, toggling between views... seems like a much easier task with React and not vanilla
            HTML & CSS. Maybe next time!<a class="inline" href="#footnote1">

            2. I looked into the process of converting web pages into Electron apps and stumbled upon many articles and
            guides online, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Maybe it's a good thing because Electron apps are infamously
            bloated. Still, it would have been cool to see this small project turn into its own native desktop app with
            a nice accompanying icon. <a class="inline" href="#footnote2">
