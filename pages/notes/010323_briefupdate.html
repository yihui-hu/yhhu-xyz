            Finally found the time to do some housekeeping on this site. I'll have more substantial write-ups for the following projects, but just wanted to quickly note the two big projects I've worked on since <a class="inline" href="https://pokesearch.xyz">pokéSearch</a>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a class="inline" href="https://arith.vercel.app" target="_blank">arithJS</a> (Nov 2022)
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="inline" href="https://henesys.online" target="_blank">henesys</a> (Dec 2022 – now)
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            arithJS began as a project for one of my college classes; my partner and I had to program a CLI image (de)compressor in C. It was a cool enough project for me to want to put on the web, so I spent Thanksgiving break porting the code over to JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            henesys is a much more ambitious project, my largest to date. It's a barebones, community-focused bookmarking site, inspired by <a class="inline" href="https://are.na">Are.na</a>, with an emphasis on performance. I focused on making adding, editing, viewing and searching for bookmarks fast, with a simple tags-based system. Please feel free to create an account; add and peruse to your heart's desire, at least until either AWS or MongoDB shouts at me with their free plan limits.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, I've been meaning to reconcile this site with my other personal site, <a class="inline" href="https://yhhu.design">yhhu.design</a>. The latter was meant to serve as both practice in web development and as a more 'proper' portfolio site for programming and design projects. But now I'm not really sure how to reconcile them. What do I keep on here, and what do I show on the other site, and vice versa? Should I combine the two? Should I keep them separate? 
        </p>

        <p>
            It'd be nice to have everything in one place, but I don't know if their styles and mode of presentation are compatible, both of which I like equally as much. I'll have to sit on this for a while longer, I think.
