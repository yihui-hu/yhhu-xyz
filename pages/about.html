        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science. Hence the existence of this website as a small experiment, which is coded entirely in basic HTML & CSS.</p>
            
        <p>I built this website in a day, having zero knowledge of HTML & CSS prior. You can use inspect element to see how simple it is.</p>
